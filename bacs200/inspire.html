<h1>Inspire Me</h1>
<h3><em>Who insipires me?<em></h3>
<p>I personally do not think that making idols out of famous people is healthy for your own improvement. 
  You can admire someone or look up to them, they can possibly inspire you to be a better version of yourself. 
  However, many "admirers" end up wanting to become a copy of their idols.
  Through many observations pscyhologists ended up finding out that we look up to people who have skills that we did not master.
  Therefore, we end up wanting to become better at something we do not need.
  Our best qualities are the ones we neglect and take for granted.</p> 
  <p>Out of everything I just shared with you, you can make your own decision on what would you like to accomplish and how to do so.</p>
  <p>Be yourself, notice your best qualities, and look up to people who can provide you with a direction to self-improvement:)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <h3><em>People, I look up to.<em></h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>After distracting you for a little bit I will now provide you with the list of peole I look up to in order to improve myself, be that mentally, physically, or professionally.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I would like to start with Elon Musk.
