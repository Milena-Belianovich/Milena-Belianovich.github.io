     <h1>Who Inspires Me?</h1>
     <p>I personally do not think that making idols out of famous people is healthy for your own improvement. 
     You can admire someone or look up to them, they can possibly inspire you to be a better version of yourself. 
     However, many "admirers" end up wanting to become a copy of their idols.
     Through many observations pscyhologists ended up finding out that we look up to people who have skills that we did not master.
     Therefore, we end up wanting to become better at something we do not need.
     Our best qualities are the ones we neglect and take for granted.</p> 
     <p>Out of everything I just shared with you, you can make your own decision on what would you like to accomplish and how to do so.</p>
     <p>Be yourself, notice your best qualities, and look up to people who can provide you with a direction to self-improvement:)</p>
     <p></p>
     <p></p>
     <h2><em>People I look up to.</em></h2>
     <p></p>
     <p>After distracting you for a little bit I will now provide you with two peole I look up to in order to improve myself, be that mentally, physically, or professionally.</p>

     <h3><em><strong>Elon Musk</strong></em></h3>
     <p></p>

     <p></p>
     <p>I would like to start with <em><strong>Elon Musk</em></strong>.</p>  
     <p>Mr Musk founded SpaceX, co-founded PayPal and Tesla, and is currently the chairman of SolarCity. 
        Heâ€™s revolutionizing space travel, automobiles, and the ways of consuming energy.
        I personally think it is very admirable to accomplish so many things throughout life in general. 
        However, the reason I look up to him is his determination to do things his way.
        Elon creates his projects and brings them to life not listening to opinions of the society. 
        Space, solar energy, automobiles and online payments all at the same time? Is it really possible to effect positive change in such a diverse range of fields?
        Elon Musk said <em><strong>"yes"</em></strong> and proved it with his actions.
        It might not be the best thing to do, but it proves his determination and trust in his abilities. Which is something I wish I had.</p>
   
     <p>If you do not know who this person is you either just woke up from a coma or are not interested in modern technology development.
        Here is a link for you to read more about  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk"> Elon Musk</a>.
        Wikipedia might not be the most reliable source of information, but it summarizes things pretty well, so I provided you with a link to it :) </p>

     <h3><em><strong>Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman</strong></em></h3>
     <p></p>   
     <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.VKHx3nL3kB-Z4v-epBWUPgHaEp?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt="Grigori Perelman" width="400">
     <p></p>  
     <p>Grigori Perelman is a Russian mathematician famous for solving the Poincare Conjecture, an extremely complex topological problem that had eluded the best minds for over a century.
        There was an assigned prize of $1,000,000 for anyone who succeeds to provide a solution for this mathematical problem. 
        However, Grigori Yakovlevich refused to accept any kind of praise or money for his achievement. 
        This situation led to many interviews (that he refused to give) and questions such as "Why?"and "How?".
        Mr Perelman was never the person to accept any prize, or praise on that matter, for his discoveries. 
        In one of his rare interviews he said: <em>"The prize was completely irrelevant for me.
        Everybody understood that if the proof is correct, then no other recognition is needed."
        "I'm not interested in money or fame."</em>
        </p> 
      <p> I not only admire his intellect and determination for solving complex mathematics problems, but the fact that no matter how important his discovery was, he never accepted fame or praise.
           Discoveries are made not to become famous but to bring something new to the world.
           If you have the ability to bring something meaningful into this world then why not use it?
           It is indeed your choice to make profit off of it but initially the ability to accomplish something others might struggle with is a gift.
           You might call Perelman selfless or weird but he lives for mathematics, he breathes it, and he is satisfied. 
           So, it is nobody's place to judge his life choices.
           I, as a mathematician myself, support his decision and admire him for being able to stay himself even after being persuaded to accept the reward.
           Sometimes, doing something just because you like it, is wonderful and is something I want to be able to do.

        <h2><em>Conclusion</em></h2>
        <p></p> 
        <p>I look up to many people in my life, be that teachers, professors, or family members.
           I always considered that every person has something they could be admired for and looked up to. 
           You should always believe in yourself and your best qualities.
           If you have people you look up to, it will definitely help you improve yourself in one way or the other.
