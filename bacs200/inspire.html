<h1>Inspire Me</h1>
<h3><em>Who insipires me?<em></h3>
<p>I personally do not think that making idols out of famous people is healthy for your own improvement. 
  You can admire someone or look up to them, they can possibly inspire you to be a better version of yourself. 
  However, many "admirers" end up wanting to become a copy of their idols.
  Through many observations pscyhologists ended up finding out that we look up to people who have skills that we did not master.
  Therefore, we end up wanting to become better at something we do not need.
  Our best qualities are the ones we neglect and take for granted.</p> 
  <p>Out of everything I just shared with you, you can make your own decision on what would you like to accomplish and how to do so.</p>
  <p>Be yourself, notice your best qualities, and look up to people who can provide you with a direction to self-improvement:)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <h3><em>People, I look up to.<em></h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>After distracting you for a little bit I will now provide you with the list of peole I look up to in order to improve myself, be that mentally, physically, or professionally.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  <p>I would like to start with Elon Musk.</p>
  <li>If you do not know what this person is you either just woke up from a coma or are not interested in modern technology.
     Here is a link for you to read more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk"> Elon</a>: .
     Wikipedia might not be the most reliable source of information, but it summarizes things pretty well, so I provided you with a link to it. </li>   
  <p>Mr Musk founded SpaceX, co-founded PayPal and Tesla, and is currently the chairman of SolarCity. He’s revolutionizing space travel, automobiles, and the ways of consuming energy.
     I personally think it is very admirable to accomplish so many things throughout life in general. 
     However, the reason I look up to him is his determination to do things his way.
     Elon creates his projects and brings them to life not listening to opinions of the society. 
     It might not be the best thing to do, but it proves his determination and trust in his abilities. Which is something I wish I had.</p>
