                                New platforms and mechanisms have sprung up to connect businesses with 
                                investors and donors â€“ think crowdfunding, initial coin offerings (ICOs), 
                                tokenization and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). 
                                Many of these new methods are driven by the decentralized finance movement, 
                                in which financial services like borrowing and trading take place in a peer-to-peer 
                                network, via a public decentralized blockchain network.
                                
                                In addition to these eight trends, there will also be transformative technology 
                                trends in 2022 including artificial intelligence and increasing digitization, 
                                which every company must be ready for. Read more about all these and other future 
                                trends in my new book, Business Trends in Practice: The 25+ Trends That are Redefining
