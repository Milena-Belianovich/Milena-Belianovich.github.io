                        <p>Understanding what drivers will contribute to growth over the next few years will inform your business strategy. 
                            According to the World Economic Forum’s “The Future of Jobs Report 2018,” another important trend that will  
                            impact business growth through 2022 is the change in environment.</p>
                            <h2><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Climate Change &amp; Technologies</strong></span></h2>
                            <p>Particularly in the run-up to the COP26 [UN Climate Change Conference] in my hometown of Glasgow, and what type of recovery 
                                we will have. I think the answer, in the words of Mark Carney, will be “50 shades of green.” It will be a green recovery 
                                but the shade will vary depending on each region’s starting point. But we have to change the way we think about this. 
                                Climate change is an existential risk but it is also probably the biggest opportunity of our generation in terms of the 
                                scale and scope of investment needed to ensure the recovery is more green than brown. The numbers are staggering: about 
                                $3.5 trillion in energy infrastructure investment every year. The question for business leaders is, how do we participate 
                                in and shape a recovery that has 50 shades of green?</p>
                            <h2><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Advances In New Energy Supplies &amp; Technologies</strong></span></h2>
                            <p><a href="https://www.gqrgm.com/3-trends-will-strengthen-renewable-energy-growth-2018/">Decarbonization, emerging markets and 
                                resilience are to thank for increased demand</a> in renewable energy. Coupled with advanced computing power, new energy supplies 
                                and technologies will drive business development in many industries.</p>
                            <h2><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Expansion Of The Middle Class</strong></span></h2>
                            <p>According to the World Economic Forum, the world has reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day by one-half 
                                and the world is on track to meeting the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) 2010 forecast that 
                                the global middle class could double by 2020 and triple by 2030. It is argued this is due to urbanization, 
                                including greater access to education, technology and opportunity.</p>
