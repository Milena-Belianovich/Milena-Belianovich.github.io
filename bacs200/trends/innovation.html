                            <p>Understanding what drivers will contribute to growth over the next few years will inform your business strategy. 
                                According to the World Economic Forum’s “The Future of Jobs Report 2018,” the top 10 business trends that will 
                                impact business growth through 2022, include:</p>
                                <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Increasing Adoption Of New Technology</strong></span></h3>
                                <p>The top five strategic business drivers through 2022 are 
                                    <a href="https://info.gqrgm.com/systematic-talent-acquisition-services">technology-related</a>. 
                                    It’s no surprise that the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the new technologies that define it 
                                    will spur business growth, job creation and demand for specialist skills.</p>
                                <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>The Increasing Availability Of Big Data</strong></span></h3>
                                <p>According to the stated investment intentions of companies surveyed for “The Future of Jobs Report,” 
                                    85 percent of respondents are likely to expand their adoption of user and entity big data analytics by 2022. 
                                    This will inform decisions and make for smarter and more pointed innovations and investments.</p>
                                <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Advances In Mobile Internet</strong></span></h3>
                                <p>Everywhere you look, someone’s face is buried in a smartphone. And that’s no different all around the world. 
                                    According to GSMA Intelligence’s “Global Mobile Trends 2017,” two-thirds of the global population are mobile 
                                    subscribers. Mobile now has the greatest reach of any technology. This connectedness leads to life-enhancing 
                                    services for developing countries, including greater access to education and health services. The opportunity 
                                    in developed nations for mobile consumerism will also play a part.</p>
                                <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Advances In Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></span></h3>
                                <p><a href="https://info.gqrgm.com/data-science-ai-talent-acquisition-services">AI</a> is already being used to increase
                                    efficiency, improve productivity and better performance in manufacturing, technology, healthcare and other industries. 
                                    The <em>MIT Sloan Management Review’s</em> “2017 Artificial Intelligence Global Executive Study and Research Project” 
                                    found that 85 percent of executives believe AI will help their businesses obtain or sustain competitive advantage.</p>
                                <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Advances In Cloud Technology</strong></span></h3>
                                <p>According to the stated investment intentions of companies surveyed for “The Future of Jobs Report 2018,” 72 percent 
                                    of respondents are likely to expand their adoption of 
                                    <a href="https://www.gqrgm.com/insights?specialism=Cloud%20Technology&amp;content=Infosheet">cloud computing</a> 
                                    by 2022. This will make businesses more agile, collaborative, efficient and scalable while reducing costs.</p>
                                <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Shifts In National Economic Growth</strong></span></h3>
                                <p>Combined with technology, socio-economic trends will have an effect on business growth through 2022. 
                                    National growth trajectories will have the greatest impact in industries like aerospace, supply chain and transport; 
                                    infrastructure; and mining and metals.</p>
                                <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Expansion Of Affluence In Developing Economies</strong></span></h3>
                                <p>Increasing access to technology and education will provide greater opportunities in developing countries and 
                                    therefore contribute to the expansion of the middle class. It will have the biggest effect on the following industries: 
                                    aviation, travel and tourism; chemistry, advanced materials and biotech; and global health and healthcare.</p>
                                <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Expansion Of Education</strong></span></h3>
                                <p>The increased access to education is partly due to 
                                    <a href="https://www.gqrgm.com/2018-job-market-trends-non-tech-industries-ramping-tech-hiring/">technology adoption rates</a>, 
                                    as well as the expansion of the middle class. The industries most impacted by this socio-economic trend are aviation, travel 
                                    and tourism; mining and metals; and professional services.</p>
