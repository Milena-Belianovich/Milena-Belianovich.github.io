        <h2>Social Media and Extremism</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container mt-5">
        <p>Recent research has been looking into violent extremists’ 
            increasing use of social networking sites such as Facebook 
            and Twitter with additional inroads into YouTube – all of which
            are used for propaganda, recruitment, fundraising (the web as 
            “theater of terror”, Weimann, 2008). Every person who can afford 
            an electronic device inevitably uses one of the many sources of 
            social media. As a result of using those networks, a person faces 
            different opinions of various internet users. The results of much 
            research in different areas show that many comments and posts can be 
            considered extreme. Those opinions even considered violent or harmful, 
            most of the times cannot filtered by the websites’ banning system. 
            Considering this situation, it is up to the users to decide if the content
            should be reported, overlooked, or supported, depending on their own 
            views and opinions.</p>

                <h3> Social Implications</h3>
                <p>Hate speech is pervasive and can have serious consequences. 
                   According to a Special Rapporteur to the UN Humans Rights Council, 
                   failure to monitor and react to hate speech in a timely manner 
                   can reinforce the subordination of targeted minorities, 
                   making them “vulnerable to attacks, but also influencing 
                   majority populations and potentially making them more indifferent
                   to the various manifestations of such hatred” (Izsak, 2015). 
                   At the individual level, people targeted by hate speech 
                   describe “living in fear” of the possibility that online threats 
                   may materialize in the “real world” (Awan and Zempi, 2015). 
                   At the level of society, hate speech in social media has contributed
                   to fuel tensions among communities, in some cases leading to
                   violent clashes (Izsak, 2015). 
                   Cyber-bullying is a very serious problem in a modern society. 
                   Many victims of online harassment end up losing their lives. 
                   The law that has established criminal liability for “saying things online” 
                   was declared as late as 2015, compared to the development of the WWW, 
                   which is dated 1989. It summed up different ways of cyber-bulling 
                   and the responsibility held by the convict. However, the internet 
                   keeps developing, as do many types of social media extremism. </p>

                <h3>Economic Implications</h3>
                <p> Researchers have long understood that social interactions can shape
                    many aspects of social and economic activity, including migration,
                    trade, job-seeking, investment behavior, product adoption decisions, 
                    and social mobility. Traditionally, however, it has been challenging 
                    to analyze and quantify the economic effects of social interactions, 
                    in large part because of the absence of large-scale and representative 
                    data on social networks. 
                    The response of investment decisions to social connectedness aggregates
                    up to influence equilibrium capital market outcomes: firms in locations 
                    with stronger social ties to places with substantial institutional capital
                     — that is, firms with high social proximity to capital — have higher 
                    institutional ownership, higher valuations, and higher liquidity. 
                    These effects of social proximity to capital-on-capital market outcomes 
                    are largest for small firms with little analyst coverage. </p>

                <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                <p>How do the Internet and social media affect political outcomes? Several 
                   papers study the impact of the Internet on political participation and 
                   on voting outcomes in mature democracies. A broad picture emerges from 
                   this work: initially, the new telecommunication technology was not used 
                   for political purposes, and thus voters with access to the Internet lost 
                   interest in elections and politics in general. Over time, however, 
                   the situation has changed, and new populist political actors have emerged 
                   who manage to mobilize voters by connecting to them directly through the Internet. 
                   This change coincided with the emergence of social media.
                   Overall, the evidence about the Internet, social media, and voting can be 
                   summarized as follows. The spread of the Internet and social media has contributed, 
                   at least in part, to the electoral success of populists in Europe and to reduced 
                   political support for the ruling parties in immature democracies and semi-autocratic 
                   regimes. There is also evidence that social media can be used to mobilize voters.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p> Social media has major impact on different aspects of life, be that politics, 
                    economics, social lives, etc. The main outtake is that there are many measures
                    preventing violent extreme activities online, but majority still remain as close
                    as the click of a mouse or a tap of a finger. The content posted on social media 
                    is hard to monitor and filter. Social media platforms do their best at providing 
                    users with pleasant experiences on their websites but as they develop new techniques 
                    and technologies, extremists find new ways of improving their ways of delivering 
                    harmful information. Therefore, it is also the responsibility of users to report and 
                    filter harmful and violent information as well as analyze any posts they see online critically.</p>
